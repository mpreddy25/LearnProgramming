Practice all programs in the examples section before solving exercise programs.

Arithmetic Operators:

1. RectangleOP: Length and breadth of a rectangle are 4 and 9 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

2. MixedOP: Write a program to add 10 to the number 456 and then divide it by 3. 
			Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the final result.

3. MarksCalc: If the marks of Mahesh in three subjects are 88,73 and 68 respectively (each out of 100 ), write a program to calculate his total marks and percentage marks.

4. CelsiusConvert: Write a program to convert Fahrenheit into Celsius.Take any value as example.

5. ReverseDigits: Write a program to reverse a 3-digit number. Ex: num : 123        O/P : 321

6. TwoDigitsSum: Write a program to calculate the sum of the first and the second last digit of a 5 digit number.
				 Ex : 12345        O/P : 1+4=5

Unary Operators:

UnaryOperators: Guess the output before writing program and then validate your answer.

1. int i = 20;
	int n = i++%5;
	-> What are the values of i and n after the code is executed?
	-> What are the final values of i and n if instead of using the postfix increment operator (i++), you use the prefix version (++i))?

2. int ++a = 100 ; 
	System.out.println( ++a);

3. int i = 10;
		i++;i++;++i;
		int j = i++;
		System.out.println(j);
