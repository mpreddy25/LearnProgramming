Programs:

Arrays 1-D:

Guess the output before executing programs

1.		int[] marks = {35,65,95}; 
		System.out.print(marks.length + "," + marks[1]);

2.		int[] balls = {};
		System.out.print(balls.length);

3.		String[] colors = {"RED";"YELLOW";"WHITE"};
		System.out.print(colors[2]);

4.		String[] computer = {"RAM","HDD","MOUSE"};
		String[] parts = {computer[0],computer[2]};
		System.out.print(parts[1]);

5.		int ages[3] = {25, 27, 30};
		System.out.println(ages[1]);

6.		String[] ary = {"KITE", "AIR"};
		String str = "PLANE";
		ary[1] = str;
		str = "FLY";
		System.out.println(ary[1]);

7. SumOfTenIntegers: Write a program to initialize 10 integer values from 1 to 10 and print sum of all integers.

8. MaxAndMin: Write a program to find the maximum and minimum value of an array. {25, 14, 23, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49}

9. ReverseArray: Take 5 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in an another array but in reverse order.

10. FindInArray: Take 5 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Again ask user to give a number. 
				 Now, tell user whether that number is present in array or not.
