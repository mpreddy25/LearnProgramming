Practice all programs in the examples section before solving exercise programs.

Classes & Objects:

Programs:

1. RectangleOps: Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods. 
		First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and 
		the second method named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. 
		Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.

2. Average: Print the average of three numbers entered by user by creating a class named 'Average' having a method to calculate and print the average.
		Note: Three numbers should be fields of average class.

3. EmployeeInformation: Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:
						Name        Year of joining        Address
						-----		---------------		  --------
						Robert            1994                64C- WallsStreat
						Sam                2000                68D- WallsStreat
						John                1999                26B- WallsStreat

4. Create Four classes Addition, Substraction, Division, and Multiplication and then implement Three methods in each class
			(Ex: AddTwoNumber, AddThreeNumbers,AddFourNumbers). Create a main method in another class then read user input of choice to 
			peroform 4x3 operations like 1. AddTwoNumbers, 2. AddThreeNumbers etc. Based on user choice read input values from user and 
			then create corresponding object and then call method with respective arguments.
